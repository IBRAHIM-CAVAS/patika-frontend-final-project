          <h3>Do you want to know how I know these things?</h3>
          <p>Selamün aleyküm,I'm X One day, I was playing a game late at night and suddenly I had to turn off my computer and go to bed. Reluctantly,
            I walked towards the roof. It was 04:00 at night and I had a very deep and long sleep there. If They Had Asked Me How Long I've Slept,
            I'd Say I've Been Sleeping For Years. When I woke up it was 04.01, yes only a minute had passed. Strange Things Started To Happen, 
            Nobody Can See Me Or Remember Me Anymore.I Heard A Voice And Decided To Move Towards The Voice. I could feel myself getting closer. 
            There was a door right in front of me.I walked towards the door and a silhouette appeared in front of me, 
            he suddenly jumped on me and entered me and at that moment I could feel the power of the universe. 
            It was as if that scary silhouette was transferring all its power to me and calling out to me.he grumbled"He said can you stand it?"
            I Couldn't Speak and I Definitely Couldn't Move. After a while, he asked again in a high-pitched voice: "Can you stand it?"
            The next time he asked me for the last time I was shaking so much I don't think I've ever been this shaken in my life.
            He Climbed On Me And Asked If He Could Hold The Keys To The Past And The Future. I nodded involuntarily.
            whatever happened to me After that day happened.He never left me.
            This continued for centuries, believe me, I don't even remember how old I was.
            But I can say that my universe changed when I realized that people could see what I wrote on the computer.Now it's time to meet...
